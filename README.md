# script-sync

**What is it?** Script-sync plug-in to run C# and Python (IronPython or CPython) scripts directly from VSCode into Rhino and Grasshopper. This project is a research utility from the [IBOIS lab](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/ibois/) at EPFL. It was developed and currently maintained by [Andrea Settimi](https://github.com/9and3).

**Why Script-sync?** Although Rhino8 has a wonderful IDE, we often miss the nice extensions and functions of a full-fledged IDE like VSCode. Script-sync allows you to run your scripts directly from VSCode, while keeping the Rhino/Grasshopper environment open. This is particularly useful if you have *AI-assisted* (e.g. GithubCoPilot) code completion.

You can execute the folloing languages from VSCode with script-sync:

|               | CPython | IronPython  | C# |
| ------------- | ------  | ----------- | -- |
| Rhino         | ‚úÖ      | ‚úÖ          | ‚úÖ|
| Grasshopper   | ‚úÖ      |             |    |

## Installation
ü¶è/ü¶ó **`Rhino/Grasshopper`**: Install script-sync rhino from food4rhino or the packageManager in Rhino (name: "script-sync"). For Grasshopper you might want to get rid of the old version of the plugin before installing the new one. Just right-click on the old icon and click *delete*.

üë©‚Äçüíª **`VScode`**: Install script-syncVSCode extension from the VSCode extension marketplace (name: "script-sync")

## How to use
ü¶è **`Rhino`**: To start `script-sync` in RhinoV8, run the command `ScriptSyncStart` in RhinoV8. This will start a server that listens to commands from VSCode.
To close `script-sync` in RhinoV8, run the command `ScriptSyncStop` in RhinoV8.

ü¶ó **`Grasshopper`**: To start `script-sync` in Grasshopper, add the component script-sync:

        <li><code>a</code>: classical output parameter, you can add more</li>
    </i></figcaption>
</figure>

üë©‚Äçüíª **`VScode`**: Open a script in VSCode and run it in RhinoV8 by pressing `F4` to run in Rhino or `shift+F4` for Grasshopper.
For Python files, add a `shebang` to the first line of the file to specify the interpreter to use, e.g.:
* `#! python3` to interpret it with CPython
* ‚ö†Ô∏è `#! python2` to interpret it with IronPython (only in Rhino)

## Requirements
The plug-in needs to be installed on RhinoV8, Grasshopper and VSCode

## Caveats
There is no intellisense for C# and Python in VSCode. In addi

## Issues
For bugs open an issue on the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ibois-epfl/script-sync/issues).

## Contribution
All contributions are welcome. Have a look at the [contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## References
There are a lot of plug-ins that allow to run Python in Rhino. Among them, [CodeListener](https://github.com/ccc159/CodeListener) was working until RhinoV8 and it was a source of inspiration for this project. This is a simplified version, but it can run `C#` and both `IronPython` and `CPython` in RhinoV8.

# For code maintainers
Follow the instructions in [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md) to release a new version of the package.

## Roadmap
- [x] publish yak package + auto pipeline
- [x] publish on tools website lab
- [x] add instructions for dev and contribution
- [x] write ci
- [ ] write tests
- [ ] ci action to publish automatic releases
- [ ] possibly redirect output from RhinoApp.RunScript() to vscode consoles or log file
- [ ] add intellisense for C# and Python Rhino in vscode
- [ ] (optional) add C# support for Grasshopper
